        <h1>Hi, I'm <strong>Muneeb Syed</strong>!</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>I’m a second-year Computer Engineering student at UCSC, also minoring in Computer Science. My passion lies in AI-integrated hardware systems, leveraging my skills in Python, C, circuit design, mathematics, and physics to build exciting projects.</p>

        <p>Beyond academics, I take on leadership roles as the Vice President of the Pakistani Student Association and the Muslim Tech Collaborative, as well as Event Coordinator for the Muslim Student Association.</p>
    
        <p>In my free time, I love building engineering projects and custom PCs, weightlifting, MMA, and late-night drives. As an extrovert, I thrive in social events, traveling, and debating random topics—always up for a great discussion. Whether it’s cooking, ceramics, or exploring new cities, I’m always seeking new experiences. On rainy nights, you’ll find me watching NFL, NBA, UFC, gaming, or keeping up with cars, sneakers, and tech. I’m also passionate about public speaking and thought-provoking conversations that challenge perspectives.</p>

        <p>Let’s connect! Check out my resume, projects, or reach out—I’m always open to learning and collaboration.</p>
