    <h1>Hello! My name is <strong>Muneeb Syed</strong> and thank you for visiting my portfolio site.</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I am a second-year Computer Engineering student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, working towards my bachelor's degree. I am skilled in Python, C, basic circuit theories, physics, and mathematics. My true passion lies in designing innovative hardware systems integrated with AI, pushing the boundaries of technology to create solutions once thought impossible.</p>
    <p>At UCSC, I am actively involved in campus life as the Vice President of the Pakistani Student Association and the Muslim Tech Collaborative, as well as an Event Coordinator for the Muslim Student Association. In my free time, I enjoy working on side projects, exploring the outdoors, staying active through workouts, playing video games, and spending quality time with the communities I’ve built.</p>
    <p>Feel free to check out my resume and explore my projects. Let’s connect and share ideas!</p>
